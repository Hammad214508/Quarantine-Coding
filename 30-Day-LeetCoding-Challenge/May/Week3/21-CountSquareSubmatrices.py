"""
Given a m * n matrix of ones and zeros, return how many square submatrices have all ones.

Example 1:

Input: matrix =
    [
      [0,1,1,1],
      [1,1,1,1],
      [0,1,1,1]
    ]
Output: 15
Explanation:
    There are 10 squares of side 1.
    There are 4 squares of side 2.
    There is  1 square of side 3.
    Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.

Example 2:

Input: matrix =
    [
      [1,0,1],
      [1,1,0],
      [1,1,0]
    ]
Output: 7
Explanation:
    There are 6 squares of side 1.
    There is 1 square of side 2.
    Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.


Constraints:
    1 <= arr.length <= 300
    1 <= arr[0].length <= 300
    0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1
