"""
Return all non-negative integers of length N such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is K.

Note that every number in the answer must not have leading zeros except for the number 0 itself. For example, 01 has one leading zero and is invalid, but 0 is valid.

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
    Input: N = 3, K = 7
    Output: [181,292,707,818,929]
    Explanation: Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes.

Example 2:
    Input: N = 2, K = 1
    Output: [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]

Note:
    1 <= N <= 9
    0 <= K <= 9
